# Project title

The Mystery_Number.

## Description

This is a little game, consisting of guessing a mystery number.

## To run the code.

I used DevC++ IDE to realize this small project, if you want to run the code by yourself, 
you can also use it or any other you want, you should open the file with .c extension in your IDE,
then build and run it. 

## The application.

I pushed the app with .exe extension (for windows) so you can directly try it.
